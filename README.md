# Intro to Data Science with R 

This GitHub repository contains the R code for the "TechConference 2021: Intro to Data Science with R" impulse session. 

We will explore [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings) of worldwide UFO sightings! 

> [The] dataset contains over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings over the last century.

We will add  [another Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/us-international-air-traffic-data) of US international air traffic to our data exploration.

* If you're interested in exploring the data, please find the two datasets in the `01_data` folder.

* If you get stuck exploring the data yourself or need some inspiration for how to tackle the data, feel free to look at the solution R script in the `02_scripts` folder.
