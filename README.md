# Intro to Data Science with R 

This GitHub repository contains the R code for the "TechConference 2021: Intro to Data Science with R" impulse session. 

We will explore [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings) of worldwide UFO sightings! 

> [The] dataset contains over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings over the last century.

We will add  [another Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/us-international-air-traffic-data) of US international air traffic to our data exploration.

* If you're interested in exploring the data, please find the two datasets in the `01_data` folder.

* If you get stuck exploring the data yourself or need some inspiration for tackling the data, feel free to look at the solution R script in the `02_scripts` folder.

## How to Get Started

There are two ways to start analyzing the data:

1. Click on the green `Code` button above, download the ZIP file and extract it on your computer. Then, download [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Lastly, open the `intro_to_data_science_with_r_2021_10_08.Rproj` file via RStudio IDE.

2. Click on the green `Code` button above, and copy the link `https://github.com/karlolukic/intro_to_data_science_with_r_2021_10_08.git`. Go to [RStudio Cloud](https://www.rstudio.com/products/cloud/) and create a free account. Click on `New Project` and `New Project from Git Repository`. Then, paste the previous link to deploy the project on RStudio Cloud.
